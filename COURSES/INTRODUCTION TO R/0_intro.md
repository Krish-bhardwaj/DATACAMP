# Introduction to R
### Course Description

In Introduction to R, you will master the basics of this widely used open source language, including factors, lists, and data frames. With the knowledge gained in this course, you will be ready to undertake your first very own data analysis. Oracle estimated over 2 million R users worldwide in 2012, cementing R as a leading programming language in statistics and data science. Every year, the number of R users grows by about 40%, and an increasing number of organizations are using it in their day-to-day activities. Begin your journey to learn R with us today!

#### 1. Intro to basics

>Take your first steps with R. In this chapter, you will learn how to use the console as a calculator and how to assign variables. You will also get to know the basic data types in R. Let's get started.

- How it works
- Arithmetic with R
- Variable assignment
- Variable assignment (2)
- Variable assignment (3)
- Apples and oranges
- Basic data types in R
- What's that data type?

#### 2. Vectors

> We take you on a trip to Vegas, where you will learn how to analyze your gambling results using vectors in R. After completing this chapter, you will be able to create vectors in R, name them, select elements from them, and compare different vectors.

- Create a vector
- Create a vector (2)
- Create a vector (3)
- Naming a vector
- Naming a vector (2)
- Calculating total winnings
- Calculating total winnings (2)
- Calculating total winnings (3)
- Comparing total winnings
- Vector selection: the good times
- Vector selection: the good times (2)
- Vector selection: the good times (3)
- Vector selection: the good times (4)
- Selection by comparison - Step 1
- Selection by comparison - Step 2
- Advanced selection

#### 3. Matrices

>In this chapter, you will learn how to work with matrices in R. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to create matrices and understand how to do basic computations with them. You will analyze the box office numbers of the Star Wars movies and learn how to use matrices in R. May the force be with you!

- What's a matrix?
- Analyze matrices, you shall
- Naming a matrix
- Calculating the worldwide box office
- Adding a column for the Worldwide box office
- Adding a row
- The total box office revenue for the entire saga
- Selection of matrix elements
- A little arithmetic with matrices
- A little arithmetic with matrices (2)

#### 4. Factors

>Data often falls into a limited number of categories. For example, human hair color can be categorized as black, brown, blond, red, grey, or whiteâ€”and perhaps a few more options for people who color their hair. In R, categorical data is stored in factors. Factors are very important in data analysis, so start learning how to create, subset, and compare them now.

- What's a factor and why would you use it?
- What's a factor and why would you use it? (2)
- What's a factor and why would you use it? (3)
- Factor levels
- Summarizing a factor
- Battle of the sexes
- Ordered factors
- Ordered factors (2)
- Comparing ordered factors

#### 5. Data frames

>Most datasets you will be working with will be stored as data frames. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create a data frame, select interesting parts of a data frame, and order a data frame according to certain variables.

- What's a data frame?
- Quick, have a look at your dataset
- Have a look at the structure
- Creating a data frame
- Creating a data frame (2)
- Selection of data frame elements
- Selection of data frame elements (2)
- Only planets with rings
- Only planets with rings (2)
- Only planets with rings but shorter
- Sorting
- Sorting your data frame

#### 6. Lists

>As opposed to vectors, lists can hold components of different types, just as your to-do lists can contain different categories of tasks. This chapter will teach you how to create, name, and subset these lists.

- Lists, why would you need them?
- Lists, why would you need them? (2)
- Creating a list
- Creating a named list
- Creating a named list (2)
- Selecting elements from a list
- Creating a new list for another movie
